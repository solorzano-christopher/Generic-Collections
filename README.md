Exercise in class to help us understand Generic Collections

# Assignment
In a new project, instantiate an instance of each of the generic collection classes described in Chapter 18:

- List<T>,
- LinkedList<T>,
- Queue<T>,
- Stack<T>,
- Dictionary<TKey, TValue>,
- SortedList<TKey, TValue>, and
- HashSet<T>).
#
Insert 5 values of a type of your choosing into each of these collections,
then iterate over the collection and print each value to the console. 
Print a line above your iteration stating which data structure you're printing from,
and print a blank line between the last item in the collection and the description of the following data structure.
